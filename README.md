# Question
Design a scheduler with multilevel queue having two queues which will schedule the processes on
the basis of  preemptive shortest remaining processing time first algorithm (SROT) followed by
a scheduling in which each process will get 2 units of time to execute. Also note that queue 1
has higher priority than queue 2.  Consider the following set of processes (for reference)with
their arrival times and the CPU burst times in milliseconds.
-------------------------------------
Process  Arrival-Time   Burst-Time

P1             0      	       5
P2             1               3
P3             2               3
